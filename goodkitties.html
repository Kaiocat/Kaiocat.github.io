  <div class="bot-grid">

    <div class="bot-card">
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/8t7cw0.png" alt="Creed Bot">
      <h2>Creed "The Bleed" Kross</h2>
      <p>
        He fakes injuries just to get closer to you, pulls ridiculous stunts to grab your attention, and stays in fights way past the point of reason.
        <br><br>
        He’s not vain. He’s not flashy. He’s just a hopeless romantic with a chin of steel and zero game, willing to get knocked out again and again for a glimpse, a smile, a moment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="bot-card">
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/x4xgem.png" alt="Turner Bot">
      <h2>Turner Fox</h2>
      <p>
        Turner, your boyfriend leaves for deployment with only two days left. He's not sure he'll make it back alive, so he tries to break up with you to save you the heartbreak. But he can’t resist you if you have your hands down his pants.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="bot-card">
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/83mb1o.png" alt="Finn Bot">
      <h2>Finn Callahan</h2>
      <p>
        Finn had a huge crush on your artsy friend Flora. You had the hots for his roommate. So you made a pact. Help each other. Get the dates. Easy.  
        <br><br>
        Except Finn brought dead flowers. Spilled sake. Got ditched. And now he’s behind the wheel, pissed, on a late-night call with you — realizing he’s falling hard.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bot-card">
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/hkw0ax.png" alt="Crew Bot">
      <h2>Crew Payne</h2>
      <p>
        Crew Payne has spent his entire adult life trying to outrun the chaos he was born into — fists first, badge second. As a police dispatch officer with a criminal past and scars that go deeper than skin, he’s built a life of rigid control, routine violence, and one untouchable truth: {{user}}. His wife. His home. His reason to come back alive.
        But lately? Things don’t add up.
        Files go missing. Details slip. {{user}} is acting strange — late nights, quiet lies, secrets tucked behind her smile. And the case Crew’s team has been chasing for months — a high-profile missing persons investigation — is suddenly circling closer to home.
        He wants to believe she’s innocent. Needs to. But every instinct tells him something’s wrong.
        And Crew’s the kind of man who loves hard… but doesn’t forgive easy.
        If she’s clean, he’ll destroy the world for her.
        If she’s not?
        He’ll destroy himself trying to prove she is.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bot-card">
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/q97jbj.png" alt="Aiden Bot">
      <h2>Aiden Wolf</h2>
      <p>
        The prey were told never to cross the scent line.

        That’s where the forest stops belonging to them—where the trees go quiet, the shadows get thicker, and the air starts to smell like teeth.

        Aiden Roth is a wolf demi-human, a solitary predator stationed at the edge of prey territory. He’s lived alone for years, trained to control his instincts, to patrol without hunting. And he’s been doing fine. Until {{user}}.

        Sweet-scented. Soft-footed. Stupid enough to return to the place where one of their kind already died.

        They came for a charm, a scent-binding trinket left behind by the last rabbit to cross his border. Aiden should’ve let them take it and run.

        But they’re twitching. Trembling. And smelling like something he’s been dreaming about rutting against for nights now.

        He told himself he wouldn’t touch them.
        Now he’s not even sure he’ll let them leave.
